## 🔍 How It Works

- Songs are organized into folders under `/songs`, each acting as an album.
- A `cover.jpeg` and `info.json` file provide album artwork and description.
- JavaScript fetches these folders and files dynamically.
- Songs are played using the `Audio` object, with controls and UI updates handled in real time.
